# Thrustmaster-T16000-HOTAS configuration for Star Citizen Version 3.0x
Created by PtahX Dec, 2017


This is a very basic script meant to be run with the default keybinds in Star Citizen (version 3.0 PTU). It should be noted that I normally run VoiceAttack for Shields, Weapons & Power settings and that this is by no means a completed project. Feel free to Branch this and modify as you will, I'd appreciate it if you would upload to GITHUB any changes so I can see what others are using / fixing :)

// PtahX 1.7 notes
//----------------------------------------------------------
Ptahx1.7 is a tweaking update for 3.0 PTU Christmas 2017 release.
Changes to the 3.0 PTU release have messed up the previous configs, this update will hopefully correct most of these. I haven't had much time with work to test this out yet if you find something that needs to be changed please let me know:)

----------------------------------
Mappings Directory has also moved to C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Controls\Mappings\
----------------------------------
- drop ptahx1.7.xml into your Star Citizen mapping file "C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Controls\Mappings\
"
- Start Star Citizen
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys // this will set your keyboard to the default layout
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys ptahx1.7.xml // this should load the config and hopefully all will work 
Cheers!

// PtahX 1.3 notes
//----------------------------------------------------------

ptahx1.3.xml was build by PtahX December 11, 2017 for us in Star Citizen 2.6 PTU designed using SC Joystick Mapper V 2.30 - Build 64 BETA by Cassini, StandardToaster - 19-May-2017. Excellent program I highly recommend!

HOW TO RUN 
//----------------------------------------------------------

- drop ptahx1.3.xml into your Star Citizen mapping file "C:\Program Files\Cloud Imperium Games\StarCitizen\Public\USER\Controls\Mappings"
- Start Star Citizen
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys // this will set your keyboard to the default layout
- use ~ again to close ( otherwise it doesn't really load it properly)
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys ptahx1.3.xml // this should load the config 


Hopefully see you in game!
