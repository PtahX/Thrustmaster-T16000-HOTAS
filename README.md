# Thrustmaster-T16000-HOTAS configuration for Star Citizen Version 3.0x
Created by PtahX Dec, 2017


This is a very basic script meant to be run with the default keybinds in Star Citizen (version 3.0 PTU). It should be noted that I normally run VoiceAttack for Shields, Weapons & Power settings and that this is by no means a completed project. Feel free to Branch this and modify as you will, I'd appreciate it if you would upload to GITHUB any changes so I can see what otehrs are using / fixing :)

Hopefully see you in game!
