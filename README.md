# Thrustmaster-T16000-HOTAS configuration for Star Citizen Version 3.0x
Created by PtahX Dec, 2017

This is a very basic script meant to be run with the default keybinds in Star Citizen. It should be noted that I run Voice Attack for Shields, Weapons & Power settings. I'm still learning this stuff so use at your own risk. more importantly feel free to modify as you like, I'd just ask that you fork your work from here so I can see what others have decided to modify. This config assumes a right hand joystick setup with HOTAS on the left. I am just setting this up so it will be a work in progress.
