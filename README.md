# Thrustmaster-T16000-HOTAS configuration for Star Citizen Version 3.0x
Created by PtahX Dec, 2017


This is am XML script meant to change the keybinds in Star Citizen (version 3.0 PTU) to my own layout. YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN TARGET SOFTWARE WITH THIS CONFIG!. I personally normally run VoiceAttack for Shields, Weapons & Power settings and have some redundancy is built in as well. At some point I will try to make up a visual guide for the binds - not currently completed.

This config is setup for the following game assignments
- Joystick 1 T.16000
- Joystick 2 TWCS Throttle
- Joystick 3 T. Rudder
- Joystick 4 Razer Orbweaver (not really assigned)

 PtahX 1.7 notes
----------------------------------------------------------
Ptahx1.7 is a tweaking update for 3.0 PTU Christmas 2017 Release.
Changes to the 3.0 PTU release have messed up the previous configs, this update will hopefully correct most of these. I haven't had much time with work to test this out yet if you find something that needs to be changed please let me know:)


Mappings Directory has also moved to C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Controls\Mappings\

- drop ptahx1.7.xml into your Star Citizen mapping file "C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Controls\Mappings\"
- Start Star Citizen
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys // this will set your keyboard to the default layout
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys ptahx1.7.xml // this should load the config and hopefully all will work 
Cheers!

 PtahX 1.5 notes
----------------------------------------------------------

ptahx1.5.xml was build by PtahX December 11, 2017 for us in Star Citizen 2.6 PTU designed using SC Joystick Mapper V 2.30 - Build 64 BETA by Cassini, StandardToaster - 19-May-2017. Excellent program I highly recommend!

HOW TO RUN 
----------------------------------------------------------

- drop ptahx1.7.xml into your Star Citizen mapping file "C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Controls\Mappings\"
- Start Star Citizen
- use ~ in game and type pp_rebindkeys // this will set your keyboard to the default layout
- use ~ again to close ( otherwise it doesn't really load it properly)

Hopefully see you in game!
