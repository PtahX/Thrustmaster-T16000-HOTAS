# Thrustmaster-T16000-HOTAS configuration for Star Citizen Version 3.0x
Created by PtahX Dec, 2017


This is a very basic script meant to be run with the default keybinds in Star Citizen (version 3.0 PTU). It should be noted that I normally run VoiceAttack for Shields, Weapons & Power settings and that this is by no means a completed project. Feel free to Branch this and modify as you will, I'd appreciate it if you would upload to GITHUB any changes so I can see what otehrs are using / fixing :)

I've tried to use USB codes instead of key binds in case others are not using standard ENG keyboards, I am using a default SC config in game still to avoid double work. I'd suggest using the "pp_rebindkeys" command in console to reset the standard key layout in Star Citizen before you start or you might run into issues.  

Hopefully see you in game!
